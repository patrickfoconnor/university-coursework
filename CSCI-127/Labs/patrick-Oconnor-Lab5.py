# Prompt the user for a list of words       |
# separated by spaces.                      |
# Call a function to output those words     |
# and their frequencies.                    |

# Download the file earthquakes.csv. This input file is described in detail here.
# Download lab6.py into the same directory where the earthquakes.csv file is located and 
# rename it according to the instructions in the Logistics section.

# Implement the average_magnitude function such that it calculates and 
# returns the average magnitude of the recorded earthquakes.


# Implement the earthquake_locations function such that it identifies every unique location 
# (use the name field in the file) and prints them in alphabetical order.


# Implement the count_earthquakes function. 
# The function should calculate the number of recorded earthquakes that have a magnitude greater 
# than or equal to the low bound and less than or equal to the high bound. 

# The user will specify the bounds and you may assume that the user will enter valid numbers.
