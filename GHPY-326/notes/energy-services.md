-  
- 

####  First Agricultural Revolution ####
##### Prime Movers #####
-  Any machine that converts the energy of any natural source to motive power

	- 3-5% of the world's natural gas production is consumed in the process 
#### Agricultural Intensification ####
##### Intensification #####
-  DEFINITION: Production of increased yields per unit of land based on increased tech, organic and energetic inputs
-  Two Key Outcomes
	-  Viable increased population density
	-  Major increase in resource consumption and the amount of energy required to produce a material


### Expanding Uses of Energy
-  Heating and Cooking

####  Energy Poverty  ####
#####  DEFINITION - Energy poor/poverty refers to two categories of people  #####
-  Lack of access to reliable, safe, and efficient energy for cooking, lighting, space heating, or mechanical power
-  Reliance upon harmful energy like biomass-generated fire for their cooking and heating

#### Sustainable Development Goals   ####
#####  13% of the global population still lacks access to modern electricity  #####

####  HEATING  ####
-  Cast iron stoves and chimneys, Colonial Era
-  Furnaces (mid-1800s)
-  Steam Heating (Early 1800s, mostly non-residential)
