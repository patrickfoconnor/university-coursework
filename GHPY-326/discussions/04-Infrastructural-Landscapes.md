#  Infrastructural landscapes


##  Prompt:
Have you experienced an infrastructural failing that resulted in the loss of a key energy service? (To put it in plain terms, have you experienced a meaningful black out, brown out, loss of heat, etc. that was caused by a breakdown in the infrastructure that connects the source of energy to you as the consumer? I'm thinking here about something other than waking up to find your clock has been reset. Have you had an energy service disruption substantial enough that you had to change your behavior?) What did you learn then, or could you learn now, about the (1) type of the vulnerability you experienced (see page 91 of book; or first paragraph under heading "Energy Flows and Disruptions") and (2) the network connecting the energy service you needed to the source of energy?
