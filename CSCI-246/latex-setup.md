# LaTex Compilers

A general multi-platform resource: [The LaTex Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)

## Linux

For ubuntu users, you can simply type:
    sudo install texlive-full

## MacOS

See
[MacTex on tug](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git/adding-a-remote)

## Windows

See the [MikTeX Project](https://miktex.org/)

## Online Compiler

Online editors are a great choice if you are new to both git and to LaTex.
However, I do encourage you to try to learn how to compile LaTex code on your
own computer.
