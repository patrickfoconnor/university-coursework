##  Create threat model of leaving your laptop on a table in the SUB while you step away to take a phone call.

Utilizing a combination asset-centric and attacker-centric structured brainstorming models I created an attack tree that has a a larger goal of Accessing Value. With this I broke into two base nodes that are based on Data or Psychical property. From there I initially brainstormed ideas on paper until I felt as though I could not think of any other attacks. After extinguishing my own brainstorming, I went to the internet to a familiar website of Hak5.com. Using this website I found an abundance of different tools that attackers may use and integrated those into the previous list.   

The image below is a visual representation of what threats are available to criminals.

###  What are the strengths of asset-centric and attacker-centric brainstorming with an attack tree?
The strengths of utilizing multiple structured brainstorming techniques are that the focus of my brainstorming session was focused on both what is valued as the victim and also what the criminal are focused on. This is efficient in that both sides of the coin are examined and it will bring together a more complete identification of what the actual threats of leaving your laptop on a table unattended in the SUB. Another strength that was beneficial in my approach was that not only did I use my own personal brain-power; I utilized the internet to expand my search into other professional hacker minds.

###  What are the weaknesses of asset-centric and attacker-centric brainstorming with an attack tree?   
The weakness that exist in a single person assisted with the internet asset-centric and attacker-centric brainstorming with an attack tree is that there was no open communication and discussion about expanding ideas. Along with this my personal lack of knowledge in the security field is a weakness that I hope to build throughout this semester and through personal studies.

###  What might you improve about your threat model and/or approach in the future.
If I were to want to improve my threat model approach, I would reach out to security professionals and have a discussion with them personally and not only read about their articles on the Hak5 website. Although I read the Attack Tree link entirely, it would have beneficial to spend more time reading the OWASP's Top 10 and also the CAPEC links that were provided on the class website.
