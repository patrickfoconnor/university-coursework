### Solving MDPs

- Value Iteration
  - Compute a sequence V_t using an auxiliary funtion Q_t(s,a) which is the t-step value of starting in state s, taking action a and continuing with the optimal (t-1) step nonstationary policy

- Policy Iteration
  - Much more computationally expensive

### Gauss-Seidel DP

- Suggested dynamic programming model

### Asynchronous DP

- Another suggestion but this will possibly make the algorithm easier

## Reinforcing Learning

- Delayed Reinforcement
- Real time DP
