try your best.Note also that this is an open book quiz, 
while all physical resources are allowed, resorting for external human

Prove that the following language is not regular.
$D =\{ww|w\in\{0,1\}*\}$
\paragraph{Answer}

Let $w=ww =(0^p)(1^p)(0^p)(1^p)$. 

Then consider the Pumping Lemma. 

Since $|xy| \leq p$ and $|y| \geq 1$, then the y part of the string must be 0's. 

But if we pump up, we'll have more 0's in the first part than the second, 
and $w\neq w \in ww$.

Hence, the language can't be regular.
